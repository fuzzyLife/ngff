## Significant comments and questions

RFC-4 defines anatomical orientation metadata.
As currently written, it does not restrict this metdata to be present only on spatial axes.
Because it does not make sense to define an anatomical orientation for non-spatial axes (e.g., channel or time axes), RFC4 should be updated to specific that anatomical orientation data can only be present on spatial axes.
