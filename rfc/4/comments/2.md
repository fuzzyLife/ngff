RFC 4 currently says the default orientation should be:

```json
  "axes": [
    { "name": "z", "type": "space", "unit": "micrometer", "anatomicalOrientation": "inferior-to-superior" },
    { "name": "y", "type": "space", "unit": "micrometer", "anatomicalOrientation": "posterior-to-anterior" },
    { "name": "x", "type": "space", "unit": "micrometer", "anatomicalOrientation": "left-to-right" }
  ]
```

It's not clear how implementations should apply this default however. In particular:

- Should it only be applied when the axes are called specifically [x, y, z]?
- Should it be applied when there are other axes?
- Should it be applied when there are less than three axes? (e.g., just [x, y])

All of this is avoided if there is no default, which I agree with https://github.com/ome/ngff/pull/301 in saying there should not be a default, because there is no way for implementations to know if a image is appropriate to describe using anaotmical orientation or not.
